# Core RPG System (`wb_core_rpg`)

The Core RPG System module provides character stats, skills, leveling, health, and action feasibility assessment for WorldBox. It replaces the earlier `wb_core_combat` module with a full RPG mechanics layer.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Stats** | Six attributes: Power, Agility, Vitality, Intelligence, Spirit, Charm. Default 10 each. |
| **Skills** | Open-ended, AI-driven skill names with a 1-10 rating. Skills are created dynamically by the AI as they become relevant to the story. |
| **HP** | Health points derived from Vitality and level. Formula: `(vitality * hp_per_vitality) + (level * 2)`. Configurable via settings. |
| **Leveling** | Three progression systems selectable in settings: XP-Based, Practice-Based, Milestone-Based. Level-ups bank attribute and skill points that the player spends in a level-up popup. |
| **Skill Evolution** | A skill that reaches rating 10 can evolve: the AI offers 3 short themes, the player picks one, and the skill becomes a renamed, more powerful Tier N+1 form. |
| **Action Feasibility** | Before each turn, the module injects the character sheet and action context into the Storyteller prompt. The Storyteller assesses feasibility and narrates accordingly. |
| **Stat/Skill Improvement** | After each turn, the module processes mutations from the Reader agent to update HP, stats, skills, and XP. |
| **Slash Commands** | `/stats` — view character sheet; `/skills` — list skills with ratings; `/level` — view level and XP progress. |

## Data Model

Stored in `state["module_data"]["wb_core_rpg"]`:

```json
{
  "stats": {
    "power": 12, "agility": 14, "vitality": 11,
    "intelligence": 10, "spirit": 13, "charm": 10
  },
  "skills": {
    "swordsmanship": {"rating": 3, "description": "Skilled with one-handed blades", "trigger_words": ["slash", "parry"], "type": "active"},
    "brutal bladework": {"rating": 5, "description": "…", "trigger_words": ["cleave"], "type": "active",
                          "tier": 2, "lineage": ["swordsmanship"], "evolution_theme": "Brutal"}
  },
  "level": 3,
  "xp": 245,
  "hp": 85,
  "max_hp": 85,
  "practice_counters": {},
  "unspent_attribute_points": 2,
  "unspent_skill_points": 1,
  "pending_evolutions": [{"skill": "brutal bladework", "options": null, "status": "pending"}],
  "level_up_history": [{"level": 3}],
  "status_effects": [
    {"name": "broken leg", "description": "Broken leg from the fall.", "kind": "bad", "duration_turns": 3, "expires_at_minutes": null},
    {"name": "blessed", "description": "Blessed by the hearth-goddess.", "kind": "good", "duration_turns": null, "expires_at_minutes": 5460}
  ]
}
```

- Stats range from 1 to `max_stat_value` (configurable, default 20).
- Skills range from 1 to 10. New skills start at rating 3 by default.
- Evolved skills carry a `tier` (≥ 2), a `lineage` of former names, and the `evolution_theme` chosen when they evolved. Tier 1 skills omit these fields.
- XP curve: `XP_needed(level) = floor(50 * level ^ steepness)` where steepness is configurable (1-5, default 2).

## Status Effects

Temporary conditions — good (buffs, blessings) or bad (injuries, poisons, mind
control) — with a ONE-sentence description ("Broken leg from the fall.",
"Brainwashed by the cult leader."). The Reader applies and removes them from
story events via the `status_effects_gained` / `status_effects_removed`
mutation keys.

Durations, at most one per effect:

- `duration_turns` — remaining player turns. Ticks down once per turn in
  `on_mutate_state`; the turn an effect is gained is not ticked, so a 1-turn
  effect sways exactly one player action.
- `expires_at_minutes` — an absolute point on `wb_time_tracker`'s in-world
  clock (`clock.total_minutes_elapsed`), resolved from the Reader's
  `duration_minutes` when the effect is gained. The effect expires once the
  clock passes it. Without the time module there is no clock, so a
  minutes-based effect simply lasts until story events remove it.
- Neither set — indefinite; only `status_effects_removed` (or manual state
  editing) ends it.

Effects feed the action feasibility judge (a `[bad]` effect lowers the
feasibility of actions it would plausibly impede, a `[good]` effect raises
actions it aids), appear in the storyteller's character sheet as "Current
afflictions"/"Current boons", in `/stats`, and in the sidebar widget and
character view panel with their remaining duration.

## Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `progression_system` | select | `xp` | How characters advance: XP-Based, Practice-Based, or Milestone-Based |
| `xp_gain_condition` | select | `successful_action` | What earns the player XP (XP-Based only). See below. |
| `xp_per_action` | slider 1-50 | 10 | Base XP granted when the XP gain condition is met, scaled by action difficulty. |
| `xp_curve_steepness` | slider 1-5 | 2 | Controls the exponential XP curve. Higher = slower leveling. |
| `hp_per_vitality` | slider 3-15 | 7 | Multiplier for HP calculation. Vitality 10 = 70 base HP at level 1. |
| `action_rating_strictness` | slider 1-10 | 5 | How harshly actions are judged. Higher = harder outcomes. |
| `skill_improvement_rate` | slider 1-10 | 5 | Controls how quickly skills improve in Practice mode. |
| `max_stat_value` | slider 15-30 | 20 | Maximum value any stat can reach. |
| `attribute_points_per_level` | slider 0-5 | 2 | Attribute points banked per level-up for the player to spend (XP/Milestone modes). |
| `skill_points_per_level` | slider 0-3 | 1 | Skill points banked per level-up (XP/Milestone modes). |
| `new_skill_cost` | slider 1-5 | 3 | Skill points to learn a brand-new skill from the level-up popup; it starts at a rating equal to this cost. |
| `evolution_ai_model` | select | `smartest` | Model preference used for skill evolution themes and evolved forms. |
| `external_skill_events_enabled` | toggle | on | Post-turn detection of skills granted/removed/altered by external forces. |

## Progression Systems

### XP-Based (default)
- XP accumulates toward level thresholds.
- Level-up: full heal, +2 max HP per level, and **banked points** — `attribute_points_per_level` attribute points and `skill_points_per_level` skill points the player allocates in the level-up popup (multiple level-ups in one turn accumulate points). There is no automatic stat assignment.
- XP curve example (steepness=2): L1→L2: 50 XP, L2→L3: 200 XP, L3→L4: 450 XP.

**XP Gain Condition (`xp_gain_condition`)** defines what actually earns XP. The
first three options award XP automatically each turn from the module's own
action assessment (the same fast-model pre-assessment used for feasibility), so
XP no longer depends on the Reader agent choosing to emit an `xp_gained` value:

| Condition | Awards XP when… |
|---|---|
| `successful_action` (default) | The turn's action is assessed and does **not** resolve as a hard failure (feasibility ≥ 3). |
| `any_action` | Any substantive action is assessed, success or failure. |
| `challenging_action` | The action's difficulty is `hard` or `extreme`. |
| `reader` | The Reader agent emits an `xp_gained` mutation (legacy AI-driven behaviour). |
| `disabled` | Never — XP progression is effectively off. |

For the automatic conditions the amount is `xp_per_action` scaled by the
assessed difficulty: trivial ×0.25, easy ×0.5, moderate ×1.0, hard ×1.75,
extreme ×2.5, impossible ×0. Only substantive actions are assessed — pure dialog
and trivial moves grant no XP.

### Practice-Based
- Each time a skill is used (detected via keyword matching in the action text), its practice counter increments by the skill's current rating.
- When the counter reaches `improvement_rate * current_rating`, the skill improves by 1.
- Skills improve naturally through repeated use.

### Milestone-Based
- Significant events (HP changes > 20, 3+ stat changes in one action) trigger level-ups.
- No XP tracking needed. DM/narrative milestones drive progression.
- Level-ups bank attribute/skill points exactly like XP mode. (Practice mode has no levels, so it never grants points.)

## Skill Evolution

Skills hard-cap at rating 10 — tiers are the only way past it. When an
`active` or `passive` skill reaches 10 (via practice, Reader mutations,
librarian events, or skill-point spending), it is queued in
`pending_evolutions` and the sidebar widget opens the evolution flow:

1. A "preparing skill progression options" screen fires `POST
   /skills/{name}/evolution-options`, which asks the AI for **exactly 3
   short themes** (1-3 words each, e.g. *Brutal / Efficiency / Stealthy*)
   with a one-clause summary. Options are cached on the pending entry, so
   reopening never re-calls the AI.
2. The player picks a theme; an evolve animation plays while `POST
   /skills/{name}/evolve` runs. The AI designs the evolved form — new
   evocative name, tighter description, trigger words — required to be
   strictly more powerful than the old form.
3. The skill is replaced: `tier + 1`, rating reset to 5, `lineage` extended
   with the old name, practice counters migrated. It can climb to 10 and
   evolve again, indefinitely.

Curse-type skills never evolve — evolution is a player-steered reward,
which would invert a curse's role as an affliction (the librarian already
escalates curses narratively). "Decide later" (`DELETE
/skills/{name}/evolution`) marks the entry `deferred`: the popup stops
auto-opening, and an "Evolve" badge on the skill reopens it. Skill tiers
are rendered into the assessment and storyteller prompts (`[Tier N]` plus a
guideline that each tier is a major step up), so evolved skills are
mechanically stronger, not just renamed.

## Action Feasibility

Before the Storyteller generates narrative, a fast-model pre-assessment rates the player's action and injects an advisory `action_feasibility` block into the Storyteller prompt:

1. The pre-assessment sees the character sheet, world rules/lore, **and the last two storyteller outputs** — so NPC dispositions and established story facts inform the rating (e.g. a bold ask to a bored, receptive NPC is judged against the NPC's disposition, not the player's stats).
2. Feasibility is rated 1-10 against an explicit rubric: **1-2** = violates world rules or established facts (the only band where the attempt simply fails), **3-4** = far beyond current ability but not impossible, **5-6** = challenging, **7-8** = within demonstrated abilities, **9-10** = near-certain.
3. Creative, novel approaches that fit the established fiction rate one band higher than blunt attempts — ambition is rewarded, contradiction of established facts is punished.
4. The pre-assessment is a **referee, not a narrator**: it returns only the determination (feasibility score, difficulty, skill/curse/passive flags, and — for 1-2 only — a short factual failure reason). It writes no story prose.
5. The injected block states the ruling derived from the feasibility band (7-10 success, 3-6 partial success/success-at-a-cost, 1-2 failure) and **fails forward**: 3-6 is never a flat refusal, and even 1-2 failures tell the Storyteller to show why in world terms and how the world reacts.
6. The ruling decides only *whether* the action succeeds — how it plays out is the Storyteller's to narrate, adapting specifics to the living scene, and never resolving a non-impossible action as a dead end.

The `action_rating_strictness` slider (1-10) shifts judgment within the rubric: 1-3 is cinematic (favor the player, rule-of-cool), 4-6 balanced, 7-10 brutal (harsh and unforgiving — lean toward failure when in doubt, success comes at a cost). Strictness never turns a merely unlikely action into a 1-2.

Only substantive actions are assessed: pure dialog with nothing at stake or trivial everyday actions (standing up, looking around, etc.) are skipped entirely — no feasibility ruling is generated or injected for that turn. Social *attempts* with a contested outcome (persuading, proposing, deceiving, intimidating) are substantive and are assessed.

## Pipeline Hooks

| Hook | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `on_gather_context` | Injects action feasibility prompt into context before Storyteller |
| `on_render_prompt_block` | Renders `character_sheet` (system) and `action_feasibility` (chat-depth-0) prompt blocks |
| `on_mutate_state` | Processes `hp_change`, `stat_changes`, `skill_changes` from Reader. Awards XP per the `xp_gain_condition` (from the action assessment, or the Reader's `xp_gained` in `reader` mode). Handles level-ups, skill practice, and milestone detection. |

## Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/stats` | Displays current level, XP, HP, all six stats, and list of skills |
| `/skills` | Detailed skill list with rating bars and descriptions |
| `/level` | Shows current level, XP progress, and XP needed for next level |

## Sidebar Widget

Displays in `slot_sidebar`:
- **Level** badge
- **HP bar** (color-coded: green > 60%, yellow 30-60%, red < 30%)
- **Stat grid** (3x2 compact view)
- **Skills list** (top 5, with "more" indicator)

The widget's "View Full Character Sheet" modal additionally supports **skill
editing**: each skill card has a pencil button opening an inline form (name,
type, rating, description, trigger words), plus delete and an "+ Add Skill"
button. Edits are saved immediately through the module API below and persist
into the active save.

## Skill Editing API

The module owns a router mounted at `/api/modules/wb_core_rpg` (via
`get_router()` / `set_services()`), operating on the active session's
`module_data.wb_core_rpg.skills`:

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/modules/wb_core_rpg/skills` | Add a skill. Body: `{name, rating?, description?, trigger_words?, type?}`. Defaults: rating 3, type `active`. |
| `PUT /api/modules/wb_core_rpg/skills/{skill_name}` | Update any subset of fields; `name` renames the skill (practice counters and pending evolutions follow). |
| `DELETE /api/modules/wb_core_rpg/skills/{skill_name}` | Remove the skill and its practice counter. |
| `POST /api/modules/wb_core_rpg/levelup/spend` | Spend banked points. Body: `{stat_allocations?, skill_allocations?, new_skill?}`. Validates totals against unspent points, stat caps, and the rating-10 ceiling before applying anything; returns the full rpg dict. |
| `POST /api/modules/wb_core_rpg/skills/{skill_name}/evolution-options` | AI call returning `{skill, tier, options: [{theme, summary} ×3]}`. 409 unless the skill is an evolvable type at rating 10. Options are cached. |
| `POST /api/modules/wb_core_rpg/skills/{skill_name}/evolve` | Body `{theme}` (must match an offered theme when options are cached). AI call that applies the Tier N+1 form; returns `{rpg, evolved: {old_name, new_name, tier, theme, description}}`. |
| `DELETE /api/modules/wb_core_rpg/skills/{skill_name}/evolution` | Defer the pending evolution (stops the auto-opening popup; the Evolve badge remains). |

Validation: rating 1-10, type one of `active`/`passive`/`curse`, names stored
lowercase (matching Reader/librarian conventions), rename collisions are
rejected with 409. Every successful call persists the state to the active save
at the current turn and returns the full updated `skills` map.

## Migration from `wb_core_combat`

This module fully replaces `wb_core_combat`. Key differences:
- HP is now derived from Constitution level rather than a standalone number
- `hp_change` mutations work identically; no migration needed for Reader behavior
- Combat-specific settings (lethality, enable_gore) are replaced by the RPG system settings
- Old saves with `wb_core_combat` module data will not carry over — a new game is recommended
